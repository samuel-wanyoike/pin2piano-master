## Challenge :: Pin2Piano (165 mins)

### Introduction

Pin2Piano is an online shopping site that allows its customers to browse through the product catalog, view details of selected products, add selected products to cart, place order, make payments and track delivery status of the product items ordered..

The admins of Pin2Piano app are responsible for updating the product catalog by adding new products and removing the products no longer offered on sale.

The app has to correctly update the inventory of product items when manager adds new products and customers place orders for products.

You as a backend developer have been assigned the responsibility to correctly model the users, products and order data and enable persistence of this data. For persistence, you need to choose the right database so that it does not impact the performance when data grows in size, or when the data is queried or when the data model is modified.

### User Stories
1. As a customer, I should be able to view all products by category
1. As a customer, I should be able to see the specific details of a product
1. As a customer, I should be able to place an order into his cart.
1. As a customer, I should be able to view orders placed.
1. As a manager, I should be able to add new products to catalog
1. As a manager, I should be able to remove existing products from catalog

### Challenges Faced With Existing Solution

Off late, the site administrators have noted a steep rise in the concerns raised on transactions carried out with Pin2Piano app. A considerable dip has been observed in the app ratings due to these concerns.

Many customers have reported a similar concern that states that often the order is getting submitted without the quantity resulting into a faulty order. The complete transaction has to be repeated to place the order again. At times, between these two transactions product goes out of stock and hence the customer has to wait for the product to be in stock again.

The managers have also reported a concern regarding the products getting added without sufficient details. This has created a poor user experience among the customers leading to poor rating.

The backend development team has analyzed the backend code to identify the root cause behind these concerns raised.

### The Analysis

The backend development team have done the analysis and below are the key points related to the analysis done: 
1. The product catalog and order modules of Pin2Piano are developed using 
  1. Node.js for building REST APIs
  1. MongoDB for storing data
2. The connectivity between Node.js and MongoDB database has been established using the MongoDB Node driver
3. The REST APIs have not thoroughly implemented validations to enforce constraints on the data being stored in the MongoDB database

### The Solution Suggested

- Based on analysis it can be concluded that, being a schema less database, MongoDB database is flexible.
- However, due to this flexibility it lacks ability to implement constraint checks on incoming data. 
- The REST API layer also has gaps in implementing the validation checks.
- A miss out in implementing validations has led to poor user experience.
- The solution therefore suggested is to use Mongoose for establishing connectivity between the REST layer and the database
- Mongoose helps to provide schema definitions for the data models along with constraint checks.
- This will hence resolve the issues faced with invalid or incomplete data being inserted into the database.

### Overcoming The Challenges

You as a backend developer have been assigned the responsibility to design REST APIs and integrate with MongoDB using Mongoose.
You need to ensure following requirements are getting fulfilled with appropriate validations enforced.
1. User to be able to view all products by category
1. User to be able to see the specific details of a product
1. User to be able to place an order into his cart.
1. User to be able to view his orders placed.
1. Manager to be able to add new products to catalog
1. Update the inventory with available units for a product. 
1. After a user places an order for a product, its unit has to be decreased by the quantity he placed into cart.

### Instructions

1. Unzip the boilerplate file downloaded to extract the boilerplate code.
2. Implement the APIs to work on the below listed entities and the API endpoints:

    **Entities**
    - Users
    - Products
    - Orders
    
    **API Endpoints**

    - `GET` /api/v1/users/:email
    - `GET` /api/v1/users/
    - `POST` /api/v1/users
      - Body (JSON)
        ```
        {
          "userName": <userName>,
          "email": <email>,
          "ordersPlaced": <ordersPlaced>,
          "tags": <tags>,
          "description": <description>
        }
        ```
    - `GET` /api/v1/users/:userId/orders
    - `POST` /api/v1/products
      - Body (JSON)
        ```
        {
          "productName": <productName>,
          "description": <description>,
          "price": <price>,
          "unitsAvailable": <unitsAvailable>,
          "tags": <tags>,
          "category": <category>,
          "metadata": <metadata>
        }
        ```
    - `GET` /api/v1/products?category=""&name=""
    - `GET` /api/v1/products/:productId
    - `POST` /api/v1/orders
      - Body (JSON) 
        ```
        {
          "orderName": <orderName>,
          "userId": <userId>,
          "userName": <userName>,
          "productId": <productId>,
          "productName": <productName>,
          "unitsPlaced": <unitsPlaced>
        }
        ```
    - `PUT` /api/v1/products/:productId <!--Update details like, name, description, unitsAvailable etc-->
